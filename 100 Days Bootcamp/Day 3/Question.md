# Treasure Island Project

Your goal today is to build a "Choose your own adventure game". Using what you have learnt in the lessons today you will be building a very simple version of this type of text game. Use the flow chart [linked here](https://app.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Treasure%20Island%20Conditional.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1oDe4ehjWZipYRsVfeAx2HyB7LCQ8_Fvi%26export%3Ddownload) to create the game logic. Once you've completed the project, you can always extend the game and make it more interesting!
